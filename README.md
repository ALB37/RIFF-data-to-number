# RIFF-data-to-number

## About

The purpose of this python script is to return the first 128 values of the data portion of a given wav file. It will write the output to a new txt file. The form of the output is as a list, which can be used as data for various purposes. I built this to automate the creation of lists for input into a neural network for a project on which I am working. The output will thus be between 0 and 1.
